**Project Name: GoQLikConnector**
```

**Description:**
To develop a lightweight and extensible connector library in GO that allows seamless integration between Qlik and various data sources. The connector should provide a simple and efficient way to fetch data from external APIs, databases, or other sources and load it into Qlik for analysis and visualization.

**Features:**

**Modular Connector Architecture:**
Design a modular architecture that allows developers to easily add new connectors for different data sources.
Include connectors for common APIs (e.g., Twitter, GitHub), databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), and cloud services (e.g., AWS S3).

**RESTful API Connector:**
Create a generic RESTful API connector that can fetch data from any API.
Allow users to configure API endpoints, authentication, and parameters dynamically within Qlik.

**Database Connector:**
Implement connectors for popular databases using Go's database/sql package.
Support dynamic query generation and parameterized queries.

**Streaming Data Connector:**
Develop a connector for streaming data sources (e.g., Kafka, MQTT) to enable real-time data integration with Qlik.

**Qlik Sense App Generator:**
Design a utility that generates Qlik Sense apps based on the selected connectors and their configurations.
Automatically create data models, load scripts, and visualizations based on the fetched data.

**Data Transformation:**
Include a data transformation module to handle data cleaning and transformation before loading it into Qlik.

**Authentication and Security:**
Implement secure authentication mechanisms for connecting to external data sources.
Ensure data privacy and security during data transfer.

**Documentation and Examples:**
Provide comprehensive documentation for developers on how to create new connectors.
Include sample Qlik Sense apps showcasing different use cases.

**Technologies:**
Go (Golang) for the connector library.
Qlik Sense for data visualization and analytics.
Use a Go web framework (e.g., Gin or Echo) for building a simple web interface for configuring connectors.
Docker for containerization.
RESTful API design principles.

**Potential Impact:**
This project aims to simplify and accelerate the process of integrating external data sources with Qlik Sense. It empowers users to effortlessly connect to various data providers, enabling more diverse and insightful analyses within Qlik Sense.
